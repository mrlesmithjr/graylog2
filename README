To change your ip address of the server you are installing on you will need to edit the script or let the script auto detect your IP for you. The default is auto detect. If you use the default of auto detect skip editing the file and continue on.
Edit the file

nano ./graylog2/install_graylog2_ubuntu.sh

Save the file with ctrl^x.

Now enter the following to start running the script. You will be prompted for your sudo password once the script starts. **Do not run using sudo as it can break some of the script.**

cd ~
./graylog2/install_graylog2_ubuntu.sh

Within the github repository there is also a script to automate a Debian 6.0 Graylog2 installation. If you are installing on Debian 6.0 run the following instead.
